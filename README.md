**Analysis of Amyloid β-Peptide (Aβ) Interaction with Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) Phosphatidylcholine (DHA-PC) **<br>
This repository contains the analysis scripts and data associated with the study on the interaction between amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) containing phosphatidylcholine (DHA-PC), as described in the abstract below:<br>

The biogenesis of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) from intramembranous cleavage, as well as the cholesterol binding site in the primary sequence, indicate lipid interactions as culpable for biophysical properties and function of Aβ. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), we identified a specific binding site for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) containing phosphatidylcholine (DHA-PC) in the primary sequence of the Aβ (1-42) peptide at amino acids 8-22. Interestingly, PC with a shorter saturated acyl chain, stearic acid, did not bind Aβ. The binding of Aβ specifically to DHA-PC is supported by orthogonal binding studies using carbon nanotubes and a lipid monolayer binding assay, as well as in silico modeling using Schrodinger’s Maestro. Further, the interaction of Aβ42 with DHA-PC results in functional changes in secondary structure and aggregation.
